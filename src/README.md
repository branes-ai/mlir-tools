## Summary of key files



Updated Main CMakeLists.txt - Enhanced to build the src directory after torch-mlir

src/CMakeLists.txt - Main configuration for all tools with proper torch



2. **src/CMakeLists.txt** - Main configuration for all tools with proper torch-mlir dependency management

3. **src/onnx_c_importer/** - Complete tool implementation:

  - `CMakeLists.txt` - Tool-specific build configuration

  - `onnx-c-importer.cpp` - Main tool source with modern C++ idioms

  - `test/` directory with lit-based testing infrastructure

4. **src/common/** - Shared utilities for all tools

5. **Testing infrastructure** - Complete lit-based testing setup



## Key Features of This Implementation



### Modern C++ Design

The `onnx-c-importer.cpp` uses modern C++ patterns:

- RAII for resource management

- `std::unique_ptr` for memory management

- Proper error handling with `LogicalResult`

- Clean separation of concerns with helper functions



### Proper MLIR Tool Structure

- Uses LLVM's command-line parsing infrastructure

- Integrates with MLIR's pass manager system

- Follows MLIR conventions for tool development

- Supports standard MLIR tool options (split-input-file, verify-diagnostics, etc.)



### Torch-MLIR Integration

- Links against torch-mlir dialects and conversion passes

- Supports ONNX to Torch dialect conversion

- Can be extended for full backend lowering pipelines

- Uses torch-mlir's testing infrastructure



### Extensible Architecture

- The `add_mlir_tool()` CMake function makes it easy to add new tools

- Common utilities in `src/common/` reduce code duplication

- Consistent testing patterns across all tools



## Next Steps



1. **Create the directory structure** as outlined in the setup instructions

2. **Copy the files** to their respective locations

3. **Build and test** the tool:

```bash

cmake --build . --target tools

cmake --build . --target check-mlir-tools

```



## Tool Capabilities



The `onnx-c-importer` tool provides:

- **Basic MLIR processing** - Parse, transform, and output MLIR

- **ONNX to Torch conversion** - Convert ONNX operations to Torch dialect

- **Extensible pass pipeline** - Easy to add more transformation passes

- **Comprehensive testing** - Lit-based tests with FileCheck verification



## Adding More Tools



To add additional tools (like a custom optimizer or converter), simply:

1. Create a new directory under `src/`

2. Follow the same CMakeLists.txt pattern

3. Implement using the common utilities

4. Add tests following the established patterns



This structure provides a solid foundation for building MLIR tools on top of torch-mlir while maintaining clean separation, proper dependency management, and following modern C++ best practices. The `onnx_c_importer` serves as both a useful tool and a template for future tool development.

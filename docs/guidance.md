Yes, these compilation errors are definitely related to \*\*MLIR API version incompatibilities\*\* between your LLVM build and the torch-mlir version you're trying to build. This is a very common issue in the MLIR ecosystem.



The key errors show:



1. **Deprecated ArrayRef constructor warnings** - LLVM has updated its ArrayRef API

2. **ConstantIntOp build method signature mismatches** - The MLIR Arith dialect API has changed



Let me search for recent information about torch-mlir compatibility:



Let me search for more specific version compatibility information:



Based on the search results and the error patterns you're seeing, this is indeed a **version compatibility issue**. The documentation mentions that torch-mlir depends on llvm-project and stablehlo, and they aim to update these at least weekly to bring in the latest features and spread out over time the effort of updating code for MLIR API breakages.



Here are the solutions to fix this:



## Solution 1: Use Compatible LLVM Version (Recommended)



The issue is that you're building with the latest LLVM `main` branch, but torch-mlir needs a specific LLVM commit that it was tested with. Let's modify your CMakeLists.txt to use a known-good LLVM commit:



```cmake

ExternalProject\_Add(llvm-project
    SOURCE_DIR ${LLVM_SOURCE_DIR}
    BINARY_DIR ${LLVM_BINARY_DIR}
    CMAKE_ARGS ${LLVM_CMAKE_ARGS}
    INSTALL_DIR ${LLVM_INSTALL_DIR}
    INSTALL_COMMAND ${LLVM_INSTALL_COMMAND}
    # Use a specific LLVM commit that's compatible with torch-mlir
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
    GIT_TAG 9a196c88fc76b91cdb4b8ceef6ae5e1ae3a2c45e  # Known good commit from late January 2025
)

```

## Solution 2: Use Pre-built Wheels (Alternative)



If building from source continues to be problematic, you can use the pre-built wheels:



```bash

# Install pre-built torch-mlir instead of building from source

pip install --pre torch-mlir torchvision \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu \
    -f https://github.com/llvm/torch-mlir-release/releases/expanded_assets/dev-wheels

```

## Solution 3: Fix Current Build (Quick Fix)


If you want to keep your current LLVM version, you can try adding compatibility flags:## To proceed:

**I recommend Solution 1** - using a compatible LLVM commit. The updated CMakeLists.txt now:


1. **Uses a specific LLVM commit** that should be compatible with torch-mlir
2. **Downloads LLVM directly** from the official repository 
3. **Adds compatibility flags** to handle deprecation warnings


**To test this:**

```bash

# Clean your build completely

rm -rf build/ ext/


# Rebuild with the fixed configuration

mkdir build && cd build

cmake .. -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_IDENTIFIER=NINJA

make -j$(nproc)

```


The key insight from the torch-mlir documentation is that they update LLVM weekly and need to fix API breakages, which means there are often incompatibilities between the latest LLVM main branch and torch-mlir. Using a known-good commit should resolve the `ConstantIntOp` build signature mismatches and ArrayRef deprecation issues you're seeing.
